#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/lock-claim-exclusive.test.sh
#
# Guards the CLAIM step of every AIOS directory lock: aios-snapshot, aios-commit, aios-note-append
# (and, by lint, the spawn lock and /aios:update's run lock).
#
# WHAT THIS IS PROTECTING
# -----------------------
# The locks were `mkdir`, on the promise that mkdir is atomic. It is a syscall that is; the
# command need not be. Ubuntu 26.04 ships uutils mkdir 0.10.0 as /usr/bin/mkdir, and on the CI
# runner it gave several racers success for the same folder (6 of 40 rounds of 50 racers had
# more than one winner, up to 10; GNU mkdir 9.4 on ubuntu-24.04: 0 of 40). Two holders at once
# is exactly what each lock exists to prevent -- the snapshot suite lost 1-2 of 6 archives there.
#
# The fix keeps the folder (every observer reads "folder exists" as "held") and makes OWNERSHIP
# the creation of a pid file under `set -C`: bash opens it O_EXCL itself, whichever mkdir the
# system ships, so exactly one racer can create it.
#
# HOW THIS REPRODUCES IT ON ANY MACHINE
# A `mkdir` shim on PATH behaves the way the runner's did: it checks, waits 50 ms, then creates
# tolerating "already exists". Six writers race each hook with a hold injected inside the lock,
# and every holder logs in/out, so the defect is measured directly as the most holders at once.
# The pre-fix hooks (pinned) run as the control and must show more than one -- a race this test
# cannot see would certify nothing.
#
