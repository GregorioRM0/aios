# unfinished-work.sh reports a note whose `status:` says the work is still open
# when no open task links to it — and stays SILENT when one does.
#
# The silent half is the point: /close-day runs this every evening, and a check
# that fires on healthy state is a check the operator stops reading. So every
# way a note can legitimately be open (a task in a project note, a task in the
# newest daily note, an aliased link) gets a control that asserts silence.
