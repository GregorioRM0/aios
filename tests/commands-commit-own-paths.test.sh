# /today and /aios:housekeeping commit the paths they wrote; /close-day keeps
# its own writes apart from its sweep.
#
# `aios-commit --vault` commits every changed path under vault/. In a vault that
# several sessions write at once, that includes their uncommitted, unfinished
# work — which then shipped under "Daily plan", "Housekeeping" or "Close day",
# attributed to the session that ran the command. Housekeeping's own Phase 4
# said "commit the exact change — don't expand scope" two screens above its
# `--vault`.
#
# Checks:
#   1. today.md and housekeeping.md invoke aios-commit with named paths and
#      never with --vault.
#   2. close-day.md commits its own writes by name FIRST, then sweeps with
#      --vault under a subject that says "Sweep" — never a --vault "Close day".
#   3. RUN: the commit line /today prescribes is extracted, placeholders filled,
#      and run with this repo's aios-commit against a fixture vault holding a
#      peer's uncommitted file. The commit must contain the note and NOT the
#      peer's file; the CONTROL runs the old --vault line on the same fixture
#      and must sweep the peer's file in, or check 3 proves nothing.
