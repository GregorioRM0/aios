# hooks/clip puts paste-bound text on the clipboard intact and proves it. Run against STUB clipboard
# tools (never the real clipboard: a test must not eat what the operator copied), where the stub
# pbcopy models the measured macOS bug -- it decodes stdin as UTF-8 only under a UTF-8 locale and as
# Mac Roman otherwise. A positive control shows the stub really mangles a bare locale-less pbcopy, so
# a pass means clip forced the locale, not that the stub was lenient.
