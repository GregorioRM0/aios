"""floor-at-start.py — SessionStart hook: the context floor is DELIVERED, not chosen.

WHY. CLAUDE.md tells every session to run the context floor first. Measured across one vault's
transcripts (2026-10-03 -> 10-11), that instruction alone did not deliver it: 5 of 16 named
sessions never ran it, most of the rest piped or redirected the output and worked from the
1.5 KB map as if it were the floor, and only a few read the floor file to its end. A rule each
session must remember to follow is the weakest kind; the harness can do it instead.

WHAT. At session start (and after /clear or a compaction, when the context is gone) this hook
writes the full floor file exactly as `context-floor.py` does, and hands the session a COMPACT
floor as additionalContext, in this order, so that what matters survives any trimming:

    1. the instruction to read the full floor file (absolute path) to its END OF FLOOR line
    2. INTENT.md's boundary sections -- autonomy, decisions, communication, escalation --
       chosen by HEADING WORDS, never by a fixed layout (operators write INTENT their own way)
    3. the titles of the newest entries of every observed file
    4. the section list of the full floor file, if room is left

THE CEILING. Claude Code shows a SessionStart hook's additionalContext whole only up to about
10,000 characters; above that it saves the text to a file and shows the model a ~2 KB preview,
which on a heavy vault was the first lines of INTENT and no pointer to the floor at all. So
every mode stays under CEILING_CHARS (characters, not bytes), each part trimmed to fit with an
explicit "(truncated; full text in <path>)" marker. The pointer comes first and is never cut.

WHO. The floor exists so every session starts with the right information, so the default is
delivery -- but only to sessions whose working directory is INSIDE the vault (stdin `cwd`,
else the process cwd, compared as resolved real paths; case-insensitive on Windows). The hook
is registered at user level, so without that check every Claude session in every repo would
receive this vault's private INTENT and learnings. Outside: nothing.
  - every INTERACTIVE session (CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=cli) -> the compact floor
  - ROUTINES (CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=sdk-*: headless `claude -p` and the SDKs) -> the pointer
    to INTENT.md plus as much of its boundary sections as fits: they commit and send with
    nobody watching, so the trust contract is the one thing they must carry
  - a vault the floor refuses (a fresh one, exit 2) -> the same INTENT delivery, not silence
  - AIOS_FLOOR_AT_START=0 opts any session out; =1 gives any (in-vault) session the compact floor
  - source "resume": nothing -- the resumed transcript already holds what was delivered

Exit 0 always and print nothing on any failure: a context hook must never stop a session from
starting. Wired per SETUP §10 Hook E. Guarded by tests/floor-at-start.test.sh.
